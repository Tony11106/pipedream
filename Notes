# Pop quiz "while" loop or "for" loop
# Suppose we want to check if a given positive integer is prime

#Anwer: use a "for" loop

# we must use a while loop

# n = int(input("Give a positive integer: "))
# is_prime = True
# for i in range(2, n):
#     if n % i ==0:
#         print("The number you gave is not prime, it is divisible by", i)
#         is_prime = False
#     if is_prime == True
#         print("The number you gave is a prime!")

# Suppose we want to repeatedly square a number until it is greater than 1000, and then print the result.
#which loop should I use?
# Answer: let's use a "while" loop

# x = float(input("Give a number bigger than 1: "))
#
# while x < 1000:
#     x = x**2
#     print(x)


# Suppose we want to find numbers between 20 and 1300 that are not divisible by 6.
#What type of loop should we use?

# Answer: "for" loop

# for num in range(20, 301):
#     if num % 6 != 0:
#         print(num)
# yet another one: suppose we want to check if a given number n is equal
# to a ^ 4 + b ^ 4 for some integer a and b.
# What type of loop structure should we use?
#
# n = int(input("Give a positive integer: "))
#
#    for a in range(n):
#        for b in range(n):
#            if a**4 + b**4 ==n:
#                print("Yayy!! We found a combination for n = : ", n)
#                print(a)
#                print(b)
