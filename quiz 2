#Question 1

# n = int(input("Please pick an integer for n: "))
# m = int(input("Please pick an integer for m: "))
#
# sum = n + m
# i = 0
#
# while i < n:
#     if m or n <=0:
#         print("pick another number")
#     sum = sum + i
#     print(sum)
#     i = i + m

#Question 2

# L =  ["hello", "string4", "goodbye"]
#
# for 'e' in L:
#     quotient = len(L)/'e'
#     percentage = quotient * 100
#     print(percentage)






#Question 3

thought a for loop would work best
for guess in range(1,11):
    #decided  10 tries is good
    guess = int(input("Please guess my number from 1 and 100: "))
    if guess <= 0:
        print("Sorry, this is not a number between 1 and 100.")
    elif guess > 100:
        print("Sorry, this is not a number between 1 and 100.")
        #Has to be a number between 1 and 100
    elif guess <= 60:
        print("No sorry that is not my number. You are getting colder.")
    elif guess > 60 and guess < 80:
        print("No sorry that is not my number. You are getting warmer.")
        #thought a space of 20 is getting colder
    elif guess > 80:
        print("No sorry that is not my number. You are getting warmer.")
    else:
        print("You guess my number!")
        break
# break for when user guesses my number
